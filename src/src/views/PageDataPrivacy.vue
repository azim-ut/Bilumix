          <p>We would like to thank you for the interest you have shown in our company. Data protection is of particularly great importance for the management of 3DDEX LLC. It is generally possible to use the website of 3DDEX LLC. without submitting any personal data. However, personal data might have to be processed when a data subject wishes to make use of special services offered by our company via the website. We will generally obtain the data subject’s consent if personal data need to be processed and there is no legal basis for such processing.</p>
          <p>The processing of personal data, for example a data subject’s name, address, e-mail address or telephone number, is always performed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and in compliance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to 3DDEX LLC. Our company data privacy policy is intended to inform the public about the type, scope and purpose of the personal data that we collect, use and process. Moreover, the data privacy policy also advises data subjects of their legal rights.</p>
          <p>As controller responsible for data processing, 3DDEX LLC. has implemented numerous technical and organisational measures in order to ensure completely seamless protection for personal data processed via this website. Nevertheless, data transfer via the Internet may always be exposed to security vulnerabilities, meaning that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, any data subject is free to communicate personal data to us by alternative means, for example by telephone.</p>
          <p>This privacy policy is intended to inform you about the processing of your personal data and the legal rights to which you are entitled under privacy law. We are hereby complying with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and of the United State Privacy Act (GSA Directive CIO P 2180.2). The content and scope of data processing largely depends on the relevant services you request. We explain what information we collect, how we use data and what choices you have as a visitor to our website and as customer. By their very nature, these explanations sound very technical. We have, however, made efforts to provide a simple and clear description when drawing up our data privacy policy.</p>
